# PolkADAPT CoinGecko Adapter

A PolkADAPT plug-in to fetch pricing data from CoinGeckoâ€™s API. The PolkADAPT CoinGecko Adapter extends the multichain namespace of PolkADAPT with data sets from CoinGecko data sources. PolkADAPT also allows for augmentation of value representation. Simply connect the PolkADAPT CoinGecko Adapter to your PolkADAPT registry and the consumers (such as: Polkascan UI) will have the commands available to get any balance converted into any other currency. This adapter illustrates the value of a particular narrow utility an adapter can have on the multichain namespace. This particular adapter illustrates a broad use-case in which the Adapter Developer has limited control over the way data of the third-party off-chain data source is serviced and thus consumed by the Adapter.

For general information and installation instructions, see the [README](https://github.com/polkascan/polkadapt/tree/main/projects/core#readme) file of the `@polkadapt/core` package.
