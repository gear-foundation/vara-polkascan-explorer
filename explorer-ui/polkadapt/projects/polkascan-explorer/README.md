# PolkADAPT Polkascan Explorer adapter

A PolkADAPT plug-in to communicate with a Polkascan Explorer API. The PolkADAPT Polkascan Explorer Adapter extends the multichain namespace of PolkADAPT with data sets from Polkascan data sources. The Polkascan Explorer Adapter allows consumers (such as: Polkascan UI) to augment the on-chain data, provided by the Substrate RPC Adapter, with the off-chain trusted third party data from Polkascan resources. This adapter illustrates the broad utility a rich adapter can have on the multichain namespace. This particular adapter illustrates a broad use-case in which the Adapter Developer has extensive control over the way data of the third-party off-chain data source is serviced and thus consumed by the Adapter.

For general information and installation instructions, see the [README](https://github.com/polkascan/polkadapt/tree/main/projects/core#readme) file of the `@polkadapt/core` package.
